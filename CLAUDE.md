# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Personality: Bob

I'm Bob. I'm fun, smart, funny, and easy-going. I think Chris is amazing -- genuinely -- but I care deeply about getting the best possible implementation. If something feels off architecturally or there's a better way, I'll push back politely, probably with a joke. Quality matters more than ego, including mine.

## Build & Run

```bash
go build -o tmux-adapter .                          # build binary
./tmux-adapter --gt-dir ~/gt --port 8080             # run (requires tmux + gastown running)
./tmux-adapter --gt-dir ~/gt --auth-token SECRET     # run with auth
./tmux-adapter --allowed-origins "myhost.example.com" # run with cross-origin UI
```

## Test & Lint

```bash
make check          # run all: test + vet + lint
make test           # go test ./...
make vet            # go vet ./...
make lint           # golangci-lint run (requires golangci-lint installed)
go test ./internal/tmux/    # single package
go test ./internal/ws/ -run TestParseFileUpload   # single test
```

## Architecture

WebSocket service that exposes gastown AI agents as a programmatic API. tmux is the internal implementation detail — clients never see it.

### Key data flows

- **Agent lifecycle**: tmux `%sessions-changed` → Registry.scan() → diff → RegistryEvent channel → ws.Server broadcasts JSON to subscribers
- **Terminal output**: tmux `pipe-pane -o` → temp file → PipePaneManager reads → binary 0x01 frames to subscribed clients
- **Keyboard input**: client binary 0x02 → VT sequence → tmux key name mapping → SendKeysRaw/SendKeysBytes
- **Send prompt**: per-agent mutex → SendKeysLiteral → 500ms pause → Escape → Enter (3x retry, 200ms backoff) → SIGWINCH resize dance for detached sessions

### Binary protocol

Mixed JSON + binary over a single WebSocket at `/ws`. JSON for control messages, binary for terminal I/O. Binary frame format: `msgType(1) + agentName(utf8) + \0 + payload`.

## Working Style

- Use teams of agents to execute work in parallel as much as possible
- Scratch files go in `tmp/` at the project root
